## TODOs:

1. Way to start the daemon for a given coin and verify that it is running (start should error if it is already running).
2. Optional callback specified to `monitor` which will send status updates to the URL specified
3. Way to send / inject commands into this like restart etc so we can reboot the coin node if bad things have happened
